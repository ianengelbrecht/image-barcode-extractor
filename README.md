Forked from [https://github.com/LACMIP/imaging](https://github.com/LACMIP/imaging) - please see that repo for details.

Changed here to only include the barcode without any other details, unless you include a taxonomy.csv file with your own data in which case it will add the taxon names to file names also. 

Run `python imls_barcode_reader.py` followed by `python removeLACMIP.py`
